## personal build of st terminal
todo list:
- transparency (if I need it, patch in alpha, selection colors, selectionbg-alpha, then get picom working) 
- functionality: copy paste keybinds
- patch in scrolling (no more piping everything into less!)
- make it nicer w/zsh (weird arrows and banners)

done:

- patched in anysize and font2 for fallback font
- patched in xresources support
- got pywal to work! it's amazing and updates on the fly
- patched in blinking cursor (good old windows feel)
- fixed japanese characters!!! (locale problem)
